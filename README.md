# PS2 EasyHDD

Many PS2 players use HDL/OPL with a traditional hard drive or SSD. This requires the PS2 network adapter. In order to transfer games quickly and reliably, removing the drive and hooking it up to a computer is the definitive method.

However, the adapter has an annoying design - it contains the hard drive inside the PS2 and requires unscrewing the adapter from the PS2 in order to gain access to the drive. I have endured this annoyance for two decades, and decided it is time to end this. (Not to mention the color-mismatch when you use a special edition PS2...)

This is the EasyHDD shell for the PS2 network adapters. It simply reverses the way the hard drive is installed and allows you to easily pull it out.

You only need to disassemble the original network adapter, and transplant necessary parts to the new shell to finish the job. The unused parts will not be harmed and you can simply stow them away.

Since the hard drive bay inside the PS2 is constrained, currently only 2.5 inch SATA drives are in the plans to be supported.

There are currently 3 main variants of the network adapter:
- SCPH-10350. The thin model with only a LAN port.
- SCPH-10281. The thick model with both a modem and a LAN port.
- Gamestar. A piece of bootleg hardware that only offers hard drive connectivity and no networking is implemented.

The plan is to support all of the mentioned models.

Current progress:
- SCPH-10350: Finished
- SCPH-10281: Finished
- Game Star: WIP
